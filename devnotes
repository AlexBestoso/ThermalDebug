We have an algorithm, and we have a step chain.

We want to be able to track every variable involved with a particular step, as well as the actual operations.

So we will have our main output variable, and our sub variables. Which are used to containe the algorithmic process.

For example, we want to output to destination buffer i, that's our main variable. But to get the output data, we need to process a handful of other variables.

So we want to not only track our output changes, but we want to be able to view what our variables equate to at any give moment in the step.
Then we can go through and start linking these variables to inverse variables in the secondary algorithm streams.

So current steps are: 
	1) Track main output variable at the algorithm level.
	2) Track operation variables at the step level.
	3) Add which operations happened and in what order to each relevant step.


Once this is done, we should be ready to start implementing the .ted file generation.
