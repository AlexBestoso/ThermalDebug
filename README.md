# ThermalDebug - Work In Progress

description:
This class and program work to gether to generate a "thermel exposure dump" or .ted file out of the programs that you're working on.

A .ted file in this instance is a yet to be defined format.

This code will allow programmers to swap out the bitwise operations in their applications and generate a series of binary files.

These binary files will then be loadable into the main thermalDebug program, where you will be able to use the keyboard to cycle through your 
algorithm per binary operation. 

The goal is to make it so that I can compair an encode stream with a decode stream and see where the process gets desynchronized.
